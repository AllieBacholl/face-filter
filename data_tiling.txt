Data tiling is necessary for the accelerator and the current plan is a tile is conceptually 
C by 3 by 18 (or 33 depending on the stride).
The order is as follows:
row 0, col[0:17] (or col[0:32]), chan 0
row 1, col[0:17] (or col[0:32]), chan 0
row 2, col[0:17] (or col[0:32]), chan 0
row 0, col[0:17] (or col[0:32]), chan 1
row 1, col[0:17] (or col[0:32]), chan 1
row 2, col[0:17] (or col[0:32]), chan 1
...
row 0, col[0:17] (or col[0:32]), chan #LAST_CHAN
row 1, col[0:17] (or col[0:32]), chan #LAST_CHAN
row 2, col[0:17] (or col[0:32]), chan #LAST_CHAN
